            It's beautiful and it's harsh. It makes the world white and bright, but it can make even the smallest thing hard - piles to trudge through, roads a nightmare to drive. There are so many ways to look at snow, so many things to feel with snow, so many ways it changes the world and everything in it.

            <h2>Nature</h2>
            <p>
                Nature's is so beautiful when the Sun rises above the horizon, so colorful and so cheering our minds to make us so energetic. ... Observing the nature for some times gives us good ideas too. The beauty of nature lies in its freshness, openness, recurrence, slow breeze touching our cheeks and the warm Sun warming our body.

                <h2>Lake</h2>
                <p>
                    The lake appeared as if by magic as we crested the ridge. It was in teardrop-silver in colour and it was shaped like a perfectly flat disc of metal. No sound rang out from the shimmering emptiness of space around it. Monastery quiet, it was lined with pine trees and the whiff of mint wafted up to us. We decided to make our way to its decanter clear shore. The idyllic scene took our breath away. Unruffled by wind or rain, it was vault still and restful. The only sounds were the bumbling of bees and the heavy echo of a raven crawking.
